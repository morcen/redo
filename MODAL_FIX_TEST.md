# Modal Closing Fix - Manual Test Guide

## Issue Fixed
Todo creation and editing modal forms were not automatically closing after successful form submission.

## Changes Made
1. **TodoForm.vue**: Added `open` prop controlled by parent component
2. **TodoListForm.vue**: Added `open` prop controlled by parent component  
3. **Parent components**: Pass `showForm` state as `open` prop to modal components

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Dialog components were using static open states instead of being controlled by parent
- **Solution**: Made Dialog components controlled by parent's reactive state
- **Files Modified**: TodoForm.vue, TodoListForm.vue, and their parent components
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained with default `open: true` prop value
