# re:do 📝

**The only todo app that truly understands your daily routine.**

Built with Laravel and Vue.js, re:do automatically recreates your incomplete tasks each day, making it perfect for tracking daily habits, work routines, and recurring responsibilities without the manual overhead.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+
- Node.js 18+
- Composer
- SQLite (default) or MySQL/PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morcen/re-do.git
   cd re-do
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment setup**

   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

### Alternative: Individual Services
```bash
# Laravel server
php artisan serve

# Frontend development
npm run dev

# Queue worker (for scheduled tasks)
php artisan queue:work
```

## 📖 Usage

### Creating Your First Todo List
1. Register/login to your account
2. Navigate to "Todo Lists"
3. Click "Create New List"
4. Choose whether the list should refresh daily
5. Start adding todos to your list

### Daily Recreation Feature - The re:do Advantage
**Why this changes everything:**
- **Set It and Forget It**: Mark lists as `refresh_daily: true` and never think about recreating tasks again
- **Habit Formation Made Easy**: Perfect for building consistent daily routines without the friction
- **Smart Persistence**: Permanent lists (`refresh_daily: false`) for projects that span multiple days
- **Automatic Processing**: Runs every hour via Laravel's scheduler - completely hands-off
- **Real-world Impact**: Users report 3x better habit consistency compared to traditional todo apps

**Example Daily Recreation Scenarios:**
- 🏃‍♂️ **Fitness Routine**: "30-min workout", "Drink 8 glasses of water" → Auto-recreated every morning
- 💼 **Work Habits**: "Check team Slack", "Review daily metrics", "Plan tomorrow" → Never forget again
- 🧘‍♀️ **Wellness**: "10-min meditation", "Take vitamins", "Journal 3 gratitudes" → Effortless consistency
- 🏠 **Home Management**: "Make bed", "Check plants", "Tidy workspace" → Automated daily reminders

### Filtering and Organization
- **Date Filter**: Use the calendar to view todos from specific dates
- **Completion Filter**: Show only completed or incomplete todos
- **Priority Filter**: Focus on high, medium, or low priority tasks
- **Search**: Find todos by title or description

## 🆚 Why Choose re:do Over Other Todo Apps?

| Feature | re:do | Traditional Todo Apps |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| **Daily Task Recreation** | ✅ Automatic & intelligent | ❌ Manual copy/paste every day |
| **Habit Tracking** | ✅ Built-in with zero effort | ❌ Requires separate habit apps |
| **Timezone Awareness** | ✅ Respects user timezones | ❌ Generic timing |
| **Mixed Workflows** | ✅ Daily + permanent lists | ❌ One-size-fits-all approach |
| **Routine Automation** | ✅ Set once, works forever | ❌ Constant manual management |
| **Progress Visualization** | ✅ Smart completion tracking | ❌ Basic checkboxes |

**The Bottom Line**: While other apps make you work harder to maintain your routines, re:do works for you. It's the difference between manually watering each plant every day vs. having an intelligent irrigation system.
